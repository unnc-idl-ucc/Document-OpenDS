# Document-OpenDS
This is a collection of usages and functionalities about OpenDS and jMonkeyEngine Framework.
<br>

## Motivation

To support further usages, replications and modifications, a document (i.e. manual) has to been summarized in advance. We hoped that it could help further incoming students could <b>be easier to catch up the key components</b> and <b>be faster to conduct implementations of customized scenarios</b>.

## Overview

Hereby, we collected and summarized them into two parts. We first presented <b>the full list of key assignments</b>, which could enable to use OpenDS Framework more easily. Then, we introduced several implementation details, which are divided into two parts: <b>"Model"</b> and <b>"Trigger"</b>.
