# Manual-OpenDS
This is a collection of usages and functionalities of OpenDS Framework.

Introduction
============

In order to support further usages, replications and modifications, a document (i.e. manual) has to been summarized in advance. Hereby, we collected and summarized them into two parts. We first presented the full list of key assignments, which could enable to use OpenDS Framework more easily. Then, we introduced several implementation details, which are divided into "Model" and "Trigger"
