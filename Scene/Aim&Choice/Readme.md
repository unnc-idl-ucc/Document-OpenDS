Goal
============


In this project, by using JMonkeyEngine SDK3, We can just use existing models or create the required models and combine to generate the scene which use be used in OpenDS. We can also set the physical effects of objects in the scene such as illumination and collision. Our goal is to use JMonkeyEngine SDK3 to build a scene that meets user requirements for this project.

Design_Choices
============

We design to built several scenes to study people's behavior in different scene. To simulate more realistic scenes, all objects in the scene are set proportional to the proportion in reality. For the first scene, the road we designed is two-way four-lane. We also design another scene with two-way eight-lane road. With different number of lanes, the driver may have different behaviors when encountering the same event such as being overtaken. We also add fence, tree and some road signs to make the scene more like the same world.
